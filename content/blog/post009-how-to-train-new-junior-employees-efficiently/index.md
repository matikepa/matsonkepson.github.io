In this post, we will explore the best practices for training and mentoring junior/mid employees efficiently.
We will cover the key steps and strategies that can help you achieve not only your but also your trainee's goals.
Remember that proper training of new employees is a critical investment in the future success of any organization.

## Let's get started

### Step 0

> Teach the fundamentals:

Or at least make sure that your trainee has a solid understanding of the material upon which you
want to build further knowledge. It is crucial to progress with more complex or abstract topics only
when we are working with the same "environmental variables." This understanding can be reinforced not
just during training sessions but also through homework assignments and additional resources, which we
can discuss in more detail later.

### Step 1

> Use Real-World Examples:

While we focus on the basics, it is important to keep in mind that the key to the fastest knowledge
digestion is operating with examples that are most beneficial in your current position. Concentrate
on tools and practices that provide the greatest efficiency in the shortest amount of time.
However, be cautious not to overwhelm newcomers! Focus on one task at a time, avoid multitasking and
constant context switching during the initial stages. Motivation can be fragile and easily disrupted.

### Step 2

> Encourage Questions:

Create an environment where trainees feel comfortable asking questions to clarify their understanding.
Keep in mind that you may need to answer the same topics multiple times. Be patient, as this task can be
challenging, and you are working with human beings. Always strive to be respectful and supportive, never
let them feel stupid. Think about ways to steer trainees towards improved answers or offer subtle hints
that will assist them in memorizing the information or uncovering it on their own.

### Step 3

> Support Materials:

While working and learning on the job, it's important to remember that your teaching doesn't have to stop there.
Consider providing additional resources, such as articles, books, tech meetups or tutorials, to explore at
their own pace. Utilize materials that you found helpful during your own learning journey, or take the
initiative to discover new ones. There is a plenty of open-source resources available online, including
excellent YouTube channels, publications from Packt Publishing, and insightful tech blogs from leading
technology companies. If feasible, encourage them to attend conferences to boost their confidence...

### Step 4

> Progressive Learning:

Introduce complex topics gradually, building on foundational knowledge to ensure a smooth transition.
It's important to remember that "a drop carves the stone," illustrating how persistent effort, no matter
how small, can lead to significant results over time. This journey is not a sprint, rather an ultra-marathon.
Additionally, there is a phenomenon known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, which highlights
the tendency for individuals with limited knowledge in a domain to overestimate their understanding.

### Step 5

> Continous Feedback Loop:

Create an environment with constructive feedback that enables trainees to learn from mistakes in order to
enhance their skills. Instead of correcting their errors directly, guide them to identify the flaws or issues
by themselves! Encourage critical thinking and provide supportive advice. Emphasize that the majority of
knowledge should be gained through hands-on practice rather than observing from the back seat.

## Conclusion

This is my outline of best practices for effectively training and mentoring junior and mid-level employees.
It emphasizes the importance of a solid foundational understanding before progressing to complex topics by
using real-world examples to boost confidence while avoiding overwhelming them or causing burnout.

Creating a supportive environment for different kinds of questions, providing additional resources,
promoting incremental learning are crucial steps. The feedback loop is also highlighted, encouraging
constructive criticism that develops critical thinking. Remember to include plenty of hands-on practice.
In general, these strategies are designed to help new team members quickly become valuable assets to the
organization and easily navigate their future careers.
