## preface

---

This tutorial, is a continuation previous of the series which you can
find [here](https://kepa.eu.org/blog/post000-how-to-setup-custom-domain-with-github-pages-and-static-hugo-website/).

[Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/mail/) offers a free business email account for one domain, which we can use for our
purposes.
The free tier is limited as follows:

- 5 user accounts
- 5GB storage/user
- Email attachments up to 25MB
- Email hosting for a single domain
- Two-factor authentication

## steps

Since the official documentation is well-described on their website, I'll spare both of us the burden of copying and
pasting.
